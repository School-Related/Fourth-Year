\section{5. Explain â€“ E factor and reaction mass efficiency}
\subsection{E Factor}
The E factor, or environmental factor, is a measure of the waste generated per unit of product in a chemical process. It is calculated as:
\[
E = \frac{\text{Total waste (kg)}}{\text{Product (kg)}}
\]
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lower E Factor}: A lower E factor indicates a more efficient and environmentally friendly process, with less waste generated per unit of product.
    \item \textbf{Industry Applications}: Typically used in industries like pharmaceuticals, where minimizing hazardous waste is critical. The E factor can vary significantly between industries, with bulk chemicals generally having lower E factors compared to fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
    \item \textbf{Environmental Impact}: Helps quantify the environmental impact of a process, encouraging the design of greener chemical reactions. By highlighting the amount of waste produced, the E factor promotes the development of processes that generate less waste and use resources more efficiently.
