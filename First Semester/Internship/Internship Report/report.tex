\chapter{Review of Literature}
During my internship at IDeaS, I worked extensively with several modern technologies and frameworks that are widely used in enterprise software development:
\section{Java and Spring Boot}
Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework used to create microservices. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications. During my internship, I utilized Spring Boot to develop backend services for the Cruise RMS project. This involved:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Creating RESTful APIs:} Developed endpoints for data retrieval, manipulation, and business logic implementation.
    \item \textbf{Dependency Management:} Used Spring Boot's dependency management to simplify the inclusion of necessary libraries and frameworks.
    \item \textbf{Configuration:} Configured the application for different environments (development, testing, production) using Spring Boot's configuration properties.
    \item \textbf{Security:} Implemented security features such as authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
    \item \textbf{Integration with Databases:} Connected to PostgreSQL and other databases using Spring Data JPA.
\end{itemize}

\section{Angular}
Angular is a TypeScript-based web application framework led by Google. It provides a robust structure for creating dynamic single-page applications with features like two-way data binding and dependency injection. I used Angular to develop the frontend of the Cruise RMS project, which included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Component-Based Architecture:} Developed reusable components to build the user interface.
    \item \textbf{Data Binding:} Utilized two-way data binding to synchronize data between the model and the view.
    \item \textbf{Services and Dependency Injection:} Created services to handle business logic and data retrieval, and used dependency injection to manage service instances.
    \item \textbf{Routing:} Implemented client-side routing to navigate between different views of the application.
    \item \textbf{HTTP Client:} Used Angular's HTTP client to communicate with backend APIs.
\end{itemize}

\section{PostgreSQL}
PostgreSQL is an advanced, enterprise-class open-source relational database that supports both SQL and JSON querying. I used PostgreSQL to design and implement the database schema for the Cruise RMS project. This involved:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Schema Design:} Designed tables, relationships, and constraints to ensure data integrity.
    \item \textbf{Data Normalization:} Normalized data to reduce redundancy and improve database efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Complex Queries:} Wrote complex SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
    \item \textbf{Indexing:} Created indexes to improve query performance.
    \item \textbf{Backup and Recovery:} Implemented backup and recovery strategies to protect data.
\end{itemize}

\section{Docker}
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. I used Docker to manage development environments and ensure consistency across different stages of the development process. This included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Containerization:} Containerized the application and its dependencies to ensure consistency across different environments.
    \item \textbf{Docker Compose:} Used Docker Compose to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
    \item \textbf{Environment Management:} Managed different environments (development, testing, production) using Docker.
    \item \textbf{CI/CD Integration:} Integrated Docker with CI/CD pipelines to automate the build and deployment process.
\end{itemize}

\section{OpenAPI and Swagger}
OpenAPI and Swagger are tools for API documentation and testing. I used these tools to document the APIs developed during the internship, making it easier for developers to understand and use the APIs. This involved:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{API Documentation:} Generated comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI specifications.
    \item \textbf{Interactive API Console:} Provided an interactive console for testing APIs using Swagger UI.
    \item \textbf{Code Generation:} Used Swagger Codegen to generate client libraries and server stubs.
